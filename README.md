# LWRLib
 A lightweight, roguelike, graphics library whose main purpose is to provide efficient, malleable, and (relatively) cruftless graphics that others can easily build off of for projects of their own.

# Requirements
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/#language=c&specification=gl&api=gl%3D4.6&api=gles1%3Dnone&api=gles2%3Dnone&api=glsc2%3Dnone&profile=compatibility&extensions=GL_ARB_debug_output&extensions=GL_ARB_draw_elements_base_vertex&extensions=GL_ARB_draw_indirect&extensions=GL_ARB_draw_instanced&extensions=GL_ARB_multi_draw_indirect&extensions=GL_ARB_vertex_array_object&extensions=GL_ARB_vertex_attrib_binding&extensions=GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object&loader=on)
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [Freetype](http://freetype.org/)

I'll add more here as I get further along. I don't actually expect anyone to use this; it is more for my own entertainment than anything else.
