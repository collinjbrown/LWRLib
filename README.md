# LWRLib
 A lightweight, roguelike, graphics library whose main purpose is to provide efficient, malleable, and cruftless graphics that others can easily build off of for projects of their own.

# Principles
- Lightweight
    - LWRLib will stick to the essentials, allowing for individual developers to add complexity where they need it but not forcing complexity upon devs who don't.

- Efficient
    - LWRLib will be optimized for general purpose graphics rendering, no cruft, no bloat.

- Easy-to-Use
    - LWRLib will be intuitive and relatively easy to plug into any project, not requiring any arcane knowledge or excessive legwork.

- Well-Documented
    - LWRLib will be laid bare so that developers can tweak and modify anything, with relative ease, that they might need for their particular projects.
